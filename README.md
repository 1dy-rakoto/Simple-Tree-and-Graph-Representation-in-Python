# Simple Tree and Graph Representation in Python

This repository contains a simple Python project that demonstrates the representation and manipulation of tree and graph data structures. The project provides classes and methods to create, traverse, and perform basic operations on trees and graphs.

## Features
- **Tree Representation**: Includes classes and methods to represent a tree structure, with support for adding nodes, traversing the tree, and performing common operations such as finding the height and checking if a tree is balanced.
- **Graph Representation**: Provides classes and methods to represent a graph structure, supporting the creation of vertices and edges, traversal algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search and depth-first search), and basic operations like adding and removing edges.
- **Visualization**: Includes functions or utilities to visualize the tree and graph structures for better understanding and analysis.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
2. Open the project in a Python IDE or text editor.

3. Explore the available classes and methods to create and manipulate trees and graphs.
- Create instances of the Tree or Graph classes and utilize their respective methods.
- Customize the code to define your own tree or graph structures.

4. Run the Python scripts to execute the code and observe the output.

5. Feel free to modify and expand the code to suit your specific requirements or experiment with additional tree and graph operations.
